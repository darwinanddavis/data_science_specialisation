It's a good idea to check Melbourne's weather report before you arrive, we really can have ""all seasons in 1 day"" so it's wise to bring something warm even for those summer nights.  I recommend the app 'Weatherzone'.  Help yourself to the umbrellas at the bottom of the stairs!

Hire a bike from one of the blue Melbourne Bike Share stations, the closest to us is opposite the wonderful Smith & Deli at 111 Moor Street, a 4 minute walk away.

Enjoy the many restaurants in Melbourne- there are some good ones, and some great ones! I love my local area, here we have everything just a short stroll away.
Other then that, you'll find both a comfortable place to stay & a very friendly host. Look forward to meeting you! ;)

Thanks for taking the time to read our profile. 

We are a regular Aussie family with a home that many tell us has a relaxed and welcoming vibe. Which is GREAT because that’s how we want you to feel when you stay with us. 
You need to know that our home is not a sterile hotel, or a grungy hostel or even a display home. There is the normal detritus of modern family life with children. But that aside you can be assured your environment will be clean, your linens fresh and your room cleaned and dusted before you arrive. There can be a lot of laughter, love (the occasional tantrum) in our home, and you are welcome to share in that, or to have privacy and limited interaction if that is your preference. We will be led by you. ☺

Above all we just want you to be comfortable!

I love to cook, travel, hear your life experiences & stories and connect with people from our hearts. I love being the helper for people's shining.

Having had conventional medical and alternative, complementary medicine practice of 30 +yrs and more than 35,000 hours consultation experience, I am putting my message in a book and a program called ""What our Bodies Ache For - uncovering repressed longings hidden in body symptoms, anxiety, depression and chronic illness""
I would like to dispel the myths of current medical thinking and inspire our systems to work on the cause rather than just the symptoms. Preventative medicine is not just about screening physical bodies but need to address underlying dis-ease ( lack of ease) in our emotions, mind and spirit).

I have a  luscious Retreat set up called ANGELUS in Mount Dandenong Melbourne, a 23 acre property for stress management and residential workshops from where you can have transformative experiences, make new friends, embrace new ways of being and return home with more of your Essence.

Most of the people I am surrounded by are making a positive difference in the world or are on a spiritual or personal growth journey of some kind. 

I love my work and work for myself. I am a Film Producer, working on a global film collaboration project. We are producing a psycho-spiritual film to inspire the audience to discover what it takes to live your life everyday  in love and joy.

I value heart felt, emotionally intimate connections with friends and associates. I enjoy people. I love going out listening to music, theatre and dancing. I am fit, eat heathily, don't work too hard these days and appreciate being outdoors in nature.

On my bookshelves you will find mostly find books on psychology, spirituality, health, business & money.

The best holiday I had was being in Cuba for one month with a women from Calgary who I had met the year before in Thailand. Our trip to Cuba cemented a lifelong friendship. I love the music and dance in Cuba and the simplicity of life. I also love being in Paris. I will always remember my first day in Paris because I was awestruck by the beauty all around me plus I always feel romantic when I am in Paris. Needless to say, romantic comedy is one of my favourite film genres.

I used to be an adrenaline junkie but I am so pleased to say that gone are the days of busyness, gone are the days of being addicted to activity and stress and gone are the days of covering up feelings of not being good enough with over achievement. Phew!! That's a relief. 

Today, my life is peaceful, joyful and mostly serene and whilst there are some limits, I have managed to achieve a certain amount of freedom about how I spend each day. 

One of my philisophies on life is, ""People do the best they can in any given moment. And whilst at times that best may not feel so great, it is that person's best in that moment.""

I am also mindful that we only have 168 hours in each week and that doesn't seem like many hours to me so I make sure that I live my life in joy as much as I possibly can.

Your room will not be ready, and you will not be permitted to check-in early. Sometimes I must admit to being very absorbed in my work which can mean I stay up very late working in the home office, however I am very quiet when I do this! It can also mean that sometimes if I am absorbed in planning a photoshoot or some such thing, the house is not tidied for a couple of days. If neither of these things would bother you then I am sure you will enjoy staying with us.","Trams: #8 and #1 tram are both a very easy 2-3min stroll away - both trams will take you in to the city. #19 tram is also an easy walk. Trains: the Upfield train line is approx 900 metres away on the west of Sydney Road. Buses: the 510 which travels between Essendon & Ivanhoe via Brunswick, Northcote &Thornbury goes right past the door, the nearest bus stop is a two minute walk.","Guests have access to most rooms in the house, including the shared bathroom, laundry, toilet & kitchen. Every room in the house, in fact, except for my home office, and our bedroom. You are welcome to make yourselves at home! During the warmer months we enjoy dining and relaxing on the back deck, enjoying the sun. You are most welcome to do the same.","It is up to you how much interaction you have with us. Some guests like to retreat to the privacy of their room, or spend all their time out and about exploring Melbourne. Other guests like to spend time chatting around the kitchen table with us. Either is welcome, however please keep in mind that as I work from home, a lot of the time I do need to actually get work done rather than socialise.","No smoking indoors. No extra pets, please (two dogs and some fish is quite enough). If you use the kitchen, please clean up after yourself. You are welcome to use the washing machine but please do ask first. The bathroom is a shared facility - please leave it in the same state you found it. Please remember to close & lock your window and the front door when going out. Our security depends on you! Please show consideration with regards to noise eg loud talking/music/tv/slamming doors/etc early in the morning (before 8am) and late at night (after 10pm). Please don't turn on the central heating without asking first. If you wish to eat in your room, feel free to do so, but please clean up after yourselves. Leaving food & crumbs on shelves and grease in the bed is not the way for a preferred guest to behave, and encourages pests.",NA,NA,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/18072046/334026f0_original.jpg?aki_policy=large,NA,2453853,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/2453853,Airdrie,2012-05-24,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","Hey there!

The only reason I occasionally host guests from airbnb is because it provides an opportunity to meet interesting people from around the world.  Therefore, I will look at your profile, to see how you have described yourself and any partner you might be travelling with, to make my decision.  Airbnb stays are very different from staying in a hotel.............. and you need to understand this as a prospective guest.

My experiences with airbnb have been fantastic and I have met people I will know for the rest of my life.  Interesting, happy, engaging, respectful and cat friendly people who have understood how to share the house and amenities.

Thanks for taking the time to read our profile. 

We are a regular Aussie family with a home that many tell us has a relaxed and welcoming vibe. Which is GREAT because that’s how we want you to feel when you stay with us. 
You need to know that our home is not a sterile hotel, or a grungy hostel or even a display home. There is the normal detritus of modern family life with children. But that aside you can be assured your environment will be clean, your linens fresh and your room cleaned and dusted before you arrive. There can be a lot of laughter, love (the occasional tantrum) in our home, and you are welcome to share in that, or to have privacy and limited interaction if that is your preference. We will be led by you. ☺

Above all we just want you to be comfortable!

We love keeping fit. Enjoying time with friends. A good red wine or a craft beer AND of course travelling!!

We have been having airbnb guests for 5 years now. It has been truly rewarding and we have met remarkable people from every continent, many we are still friends or in contact with.

We try to travel and explore the world, as much as possible. We love experiencing different cultures and enjoying great food!
We prefer to experience the local culture, rather than stopping only a couple of days in a place, and heading on to the next location. Meeting the locals is what makes the experience all the more worthwhile! Airbnb is great for this :)

We have had many people stay with us over the last couple of years, and have really enjoyed each and every experience. 

What is important about Airbnb is the relationship and communication between the host and the guest. So far we’ve had some great experiences, and hope this continues.

During the week I work in my recording studio and am busy writing and producing music, as well as remixing and producing other artists. I also direct videoclips.
If you're interested in synthpop/electronic music then do a search for ""Parralox"".

As such, I usually travel overseas at least 3 times a year. Travel is one of the best things in the world (long haul flights, not so much!)

On the weekends I work as a registered Nurse (Permanent Night Shifts!) at a major Melbourne City Hospital.

I also dabble in property investment and my current property portfolio is 7 properties so far. You'll find some of them listed here on AirBNB from time to time!

I'm a MAJOR Science Fiction fan. Favourite authors are Larry Niven, Arthur C Clarke and Frank Herbert. Favourite directors are David Lynch & Stanley Kubrick.

I'm very passionate about Animal Rights. Animal cruelty is my biggest hate. I donate monthly to The Lost Dogs Home.
I have a dog called Jack that I treat like absolute gold. You’ll get to meet him when I check you in!
 With so much suffering on this planet I figure that if I can give one animal a perfect life then I'm doing something good.",within an hour,100%,98%,TRUE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/4986236/profile_pic/1360213888/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/4986236/profile_pic/1360213888/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Central Business District,4,4,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'google', 'reviews', 'offline_government_id', 'government_id', 'work_email']",TRUE,FALSE,"Melbourne, VIC, Australia",Central Business District,Melbourne,NA,Melbourne,VIC,3000,Melbourne,"Melbourne, Australia",AU,Australia,-37.80903,144.96444,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,2,1,1,1,Real Bed,"{TV,""Cable TV"",Wifi,Pool,Kitchen,""Paid parking off premises"",Elevator,""Free street parking"",Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"",""Room-darkening shades"",""Hot water"",""Bed linens"",""Extra pillows and blankets"",""Ethernet connection"",Microwave,Refrigerator,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",""Long term stays allowed"",""Host greets you"",""Paid parking on premises""}",0,$120.00,$760.00,"$2,300.00",$150.00,$40.00,1,$0.00,10,1125,10,10,1125,1125,10,1125,2 months ago,TRUE,22,33,33,306,2020-03-16,179,21,2013-11-24,2020-03-06,96,10,10,10,10,10,9,FALSE,NA,NA,FALSE,FALSE,strict_14_with_grace_period,FALSE,FALSE,3,3,0,0,2.33

Airbnb is a great way to do that and is instrumental in helping me finish off my home renovations.  My goal is to provide an exceptional level of accommodation for people at a reasonable price, and I am constantly working to improve the rooms, house and garden to make everything look & feel beautiful. 

Some personal things -

I love going out & go to live music events regularly ... I also play music so have a great network of musical friends.
I also enjoy going to outdoor music parties and you will often find me out in the bush with my caravan filling my days with laughter, dancing & hugs.
In the past I have hosted many travellers through the couch surfing & helpx groups offering free accommodation and have met people from all over the world making many new friends.
I have travelled to many countries myself and spent 5 years living & working in London with Europe at my door, & I really enjoyed the little weekend jaunts as it was so close & easy.
I like to live life to the full & try to bring some happiness to the world around me. Embracing the differences of others & celebrating diversity is a big part of that. 
Above all; kindness & love rule my life ... and a smile from the heart is a gift we can all share.

*I run my house primarily on my own with limited income and sometimes things don't work properly which can happen with older homes. This won't affect the quality of your stay of course but is worth noting*
*Solo male guests - Airbnb now only reveals a profile picture when a booking is confirmed. As this presents a personal safety issue (my home is my sanctuary after all), I will require access to a picture of your face elsewhere prior to confirmation and I may ask a few extra questions about your stay*

I look forward to welcoming you into my home :-)

An English girl abroad I first visited Australia in 2008.  My then 4 year old daughter and I toured the East coast in a camper van and completely fell in love with this gloriously laid-back country. Melbourne became our home over 6 years ago and  I have to say, I love this place.
I love the beach, I love the creativity you find within every nook and cranny of this city, I love the coffee, the cheap eats and cafes, the fancy restaurants and global cuisines. I love the markets, the lost afternoons at the park with the kids, I love the stunning views offered by a walk around the famous Albert Park lake, the glorious summer days and the rugged up winters but most of all I love sharing it, enjoying Melbourne with family, friends, sharing her secrets with visitors.

We both got the AIRBNB bug from our own hosted experiences in Prague, Paris and Amsterdam and started hosting over 10 years ago. Passionate about Melbourne it gives us a great buzz to be able to share our city and knowledge with visitors and hope that we can provide a great base for your Melbourne stay.

Love, Children, Beauty, Creativity, Stillness.

I'd like to begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of country - the Boon Wurrung clan of the Kulin nation, people who have held and walked this land for thousands of years. We are the beneficiary of their ceremonies.
 
Thank you, now a bit about me...I've lived and worked in Asia as a fine artist and am planning to travel to France and Italy with my daughter in September on a spiritual pilgrimage through labyrinths. Yay!

My fave books are The Alchemist and Ashes and Snow. Fave movies include The Intouchables, The Big Blue, Under a Tuscan Sun. I'm rather a ridiculous fan of HP, Sherlock and Miss M (much to my families displeasure...""oh not again Mum..."".

As a traveller I tend to be a pilgrim more than a tourist - however much I try. I just like to connect, put down roots, feel the pace of the place rather than run from one monument to the next clicking madly.

I'd love to travel on the Orient Express - 1st class of course. Train travel seems so civilised when one has one's own compartment! Far kinder than the crick in my neck from that last overnight flight back from India.

I travel for work (shall I call it that?) fine art exhibiting and now presenting on the labyrinth at conferences. It takes effort but it has my soul sing!

On that front, I have a deadline from my publisher to complete A HANDMADE LIFE - how to transition from a 'cookie cutter' life to a created, handmade life and be a soul happy mama.

I'm not an intrusive person. I don't want to be your instant best pal but if you stay with us (and we have a stream of house guests from all over the world between Pete and myself), my intention is that people feel cared for whilst they're in our space. 

I aim to create spaces that support people being able to rest, relax and leave enriched. The strike rate's pretty good so far...but hey, it's not hard when you're connecting with beautiful people!

I started StayCentral with one apartment in 2005, and now manage multiple properties in many different locations in inner Melbourne.

Like many of my guests, I love to travel; both overseas to places like the Mulu Caves in Borneo, ancient cities (in many old countries), Antarctica & Alaska, Torres del Paine, and colourful markets in amazing places like Pha Long in Vietnam, Jaisalmer in India, & La Paz in Bolivia. I also love short domestic trips for weekends away just to relax. It means I get to be on the other side of the counter, and experience how other people look after their guests: and I take their good ideas back with me. 

(My manager, Max, has also travelled from afar to be here by the way, and he can also speak with our guests in Russian and Ukranian).

I even worked as a part-time tourist guide in Melbourne for a couple of years, and really enjoyed the interactions with the tourists off the huge cruise liners that appear in Melbourne each spring and summer. I have tried to extend this experience into my accommodation business here at home, where I really love assisting people with their stays. You only need to read the 800 plus reviews on Airbnb, Trip advisor, Goo gle, and on my own StayCentral website to realise how much our guests enjoy our apartments, and the way we look after them. 

I do love living in Melbourne. It enjoys a unique place in Australia. It is often described as the cultural, business, shopping and sporting capital of the country. The restaurants and cafes in Melbourne are amongst the best in the world. I love living in an urban village amongst these, and all the other everyday shops; and jumping on a tram and avoiding the hassles of traffic. It is a city of great opportunity, experiences, events and lifestyle that can be enjoyed by locals and visitors alike; and I really enjoy facilitating our guests' stays here.

I do hope I have the opportunity to help you get to know Melbourne and grow to love it as I have.",within an hour,100%,100%,TRUE,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/19936ae6-b4cf-48e2-b6ed-7ad9c2eff7e6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/19936ae6-b4cf-48e2-b6ed-7ad9c2eff7e6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,South Wharf,27,27,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'google', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'government_id', 'work_email']",TRUE,TRUE,"Southbank, VIC, Australia",South Wharf,Melbourne,NA,Southbank,VIC,3006,Melbourne,"Southbank, Australia",AU,Australia,-37.82521,144.9533,TRUE,Apartment,Entire home/apt,5,2,2,2,Real Bed,"{TV,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Pool,Kitchen,""Free parking on premises"",""Pets allowed"",Gym,Elevator,""Buzzer/wireless intercom"",Heating,""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""24-hour check-in"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Self check-in"",""Building staff"",""Private living room"",""Private entrance"",""Hot water"",""Bed linens"",""Extra pillows and blankets"",Microwave,Refrigerator,Dishwasher,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove,""Single level home"",""BBQ grill"",""Patio or balcony"",""Garden or backyard"",""Long term stays allowed""}",0,$258.00,NA,NA,$0.00,$0.00,4,$21.00,3,90,1,3,90,90,2.6,90,today,TRUE,1,1,1,180,2020-03-16,14,2,2013-07-27,2019-10-07,94,10,9,9,9,10,9,FALSE,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,strict_14_with_grace_period,FALSE,FALSE,26,24,0,0,0.17

I'm Jonathan, I'm in my mid 40's, sometimes older sometimes younger and I love to travel. 

In terms of a home I love a comfy couch, I love a deep bath and I love full blockout curtains. 

5 things I can't live without?

Books, I love a good book.
Good food. I love sharing a great meal with others.
Long sleep in's on Sundays or any day really.
Water. I love swimming in the ocean or rivers. Lets keep them clean.
Music. Anything from opera to house.

As your host, I will be on call to make your stay as comfortable as possible. If anything goes wrong during your stay, say the washing machine won't start or something, I will have it sorted immediately. I've had guest stay at my place for 3 month and then extend up to 16 months. I've had guests who moved out and then told me if they could stay forever they would be very happy. 

As someone who has travelled a lot with work and stayed in hotels motels and apartments both long and short term, I set out to create a space that was a real home away from home. Somewhere where you can feel safe, warm and cosy and enjoy a good home cooked meal. It was all about atmosphere. A deep bath to relax in, comfy couches to put your feet up on, a big TV to tune out to and stunning view whilst enjoying your breakfast. In winter turn on the gas log fireplace and enjoy a glass of wine. Head out to one of the many great eating establishments on Chapel St, Fitzroy St or take a tram to the city. the tram stop is a 2 minute walk away.

I am married to Mario.

We both enjoy gardening and creating and growing our own produce when we can.
We both love people and sharing our wisdom & knowledge.  I am a professional Life Coach and Bars Facilitator and have been assisting and guiding people for many year.  
I enjoy the beach  both summer and winter.  At every opportunity especially in the cooler months, both Mario and I enjoy going to Peninsula Hot Springs in Rye.
I love experiencing other cultures and listening to different accents.
We have been to India many times as it feeds my soul and in turn bring that back to infuses others.  We also assist an orphanage in Mysore.

We love to travel, especially Italy as Mario has family living in Tuscany.  And we both speak italian.

I love a great film, especially if based on or inspired by true life happenings.  Mario also loves, loves action films.

We both love good quality food, simply cooked.   One of our favourite ingredient is a really good olive oil.

As for Baringa Villa.
When friends or guest stay they all comment on the tranquility of the place and how they could just sit, linger, and enjoy the peace and calm.
Given that our home is now bigger than we required!   And that we were able to easily create the private space,  Baringa Villa was born.

We really look forwards to your stay with us!

If you book with me you'll be communicating with both myself and my team.

I’m an entrepreneur, architecture graduate, photographer, cyclist (NOT the lycra kind), volunteer, adventurer and problem solver.

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world. My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

I love discovering authentic experiences when I travel and I love being able to share the opportunity with others, to live like a local when they travel too.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

My listings are all managed by Beyond a Room. My aim is to give guests a unique and local perspective on the location and share my knowledge and experience of this wonderful city with travellers so that they feel at home.

I have traveled quite extensively every 2-3 years for usually 3-4 months at a time. The first time I traveled Overseas alone was when I was 16, to the US and Canada.  I lived in the UK for 2 1/2 years and again for 3 months last year and most of my traveling has been backpacking and used other sharing economy websites, staying on couches and letting out my couch.  I used AirBnB during my 3 week trip to New Zealand in 2013 and thought this is perfect for me living right in the heart of the city and working in Tourism and Events I can share my local knowledge with the world... one guest at a time.

I work in Events Management and have worked on such exciting events as the London Olympics 2012, The Commonwealth Games, The Australian Open and the Tim Burton Exhibition Opening at ACMI.

I love horse riding, travel, theatre, comedy shows, live bands and seeing and experiencing what the world has to offer.  I have traveled extensively but I am in love with Melbourne and its many faces.

I am a frugal traveler and love to share my tips and there is a lot to see and do in Melbourne that is free.  I currently work in the Tourism Industry so I know this place pretty well and living in the city well, it give life a completely different flavour, I love it.

Why AirBnB?
Simple as a keen traveler and loving my city I want to share it.  I live in a central location and I have had many friends across the world stay, some whom I have met on my travels, some who became friends after they stayed.

AirBnB will help me stay in my apartment, living in the city can be quite expensive so by utilsing AirBnB I can continue to live in the city I love.

AirBnB has helped me renovate upstairs, removing my carpet and replacing with floorboards.  Installing a custom blind of Melbourne's art centre and skyline, and most recently it contributed to an new kitchen! How awesome is that!

I've been hosting on airbnb for over 4 years now and have held Superhost status since it was introduced. I host several properties and respond to ALL requests and mostly within an hour - unless your request is from another time zone but even then I will respond asap. 

I am an energetic person that loves meeting new people and even if I don't get to meet you, I am always contactable and willing to assist with your enquiry. 

I try to ensure my guests have the experience of a wonderful stay and make their trip to Melbourne (or Yarrawonga) a memorable one. I have travelled extensively myself and know how important it is to obtain information and assistance without too much bother. 

I have lived in Melbourne all my life and like to share my passion with others to make their stay memorable.

I have several types of accommodation available and provide greater discounts for longer stays so please take a look at the pricing options.  I like to provide all the comforts to my guests as I myself would like them provided if I were to stay.  

You will see that there aren't too many reviews on my spaces considering the number of years that I have been hosting but that's due to the fact that many come and stay for longer periods as I provide significant discounts for stays of a month or more. I also have several guests coming back for 3 or more visits.

Melbourne has been voted now the most liveable city in the world - several times over in case you haven't already heard :)

If you book with me you'll be communicating with both myself and my team.

I’m an entrepreneur, architecture graduate, photographer, cyclist (NOT the lycra kind), volunteer, adventurer and problem solver.

During my studies I worked at various cafes and architecture offices to save up for shoestring trips around the world. My grandma once told me I had ‘champagne taste but a beer budget’ and it’s a motto I’ve enjoyed applying to different parts of my life to get the more out of less and find enjoyment in the little things.

I love discovering authentic experiences when I travel and I love being able to share the opportunity with others, to live like a local when they travel too.

Some of my most memorable trips have been couch-surfin across Russia while taking the Trans Siberian, living in Helsinki and learning to hand build furniture, riding a vintage steel bicycle through France to race in L’Eroica and buying a car on craigzlist in Los Angeles and driving across the south, east and north coasts to arrive in Vancouver.

I have traveled quite extensively every 2-3 years for usually 3-4 months at a time. The first time I traveled Overseas alone was when I was 16, to the US and Canada.  I lived in the UK for 2 1/2 years and again for 3 months last year and most of my traveling has been backpacking and used other sharing economy websites, staying on couches and letting out my couch.  I used AirBnB during my 3 week trip to New Zealand in 2013 and thought this is perfect for me living right in the heart of the city and working in Tourism and Events I can share my local knowledge with the world... one guest at a time.

I work in Events Management and have worked on such exciting events as the London Olympics 2012, The Commonwealth Games, The Australian Open and the Tim Burton Exhibition Opening at ACMI.

I love horse riding, travel, theatre, comedy shows, live bands and seeing and experiencing what the world has to offer.  I have traveled extensively but I am in love with Melbourne and its many faces.

I am a frugal traveler and love to share my tips and there is a lot to see and do in Melbourne that is free.  I currently work in the Tourism Industry so I know this place pretty well and living in the city well, it give life a completely different flavour, I love it.

Why AirBnB?
Simple as a keen traveler and loving my city I want to share it.  I live in a central location and I have had many friends across the world stay, some whom I have met on my travels, some who became friends after they stayed.

AirBnB will help me stay in my apartment, living in the city can be quite expensive so by utilsing AirBnB I can continue to live in the city I love.

AirBnB has helped me renovate upstairs, removing my carpet and replacing with floorboards.  Installing a custom blind of Melbourne's art centre and skyline, and most recently it contributed to an new kitchen! How awesome is that!

Next goal your stay is contributing to:  Renovating the laundry/powder room.

I started StayCentral with one apartment in 2005, and now manage multiple properties in many different locations in inner Melbourne.

Like many of my guests, I love to travel; both overseas to places like the Mulu Caves in Borneo, ancient cities (in many old countries), Antarctica & Alaska, Torres del Paine, and colourful markets in amazing places like Pha Long in Vietnam, Jaisalmer in India, & La Paz in Bolivia. I also love short domestic trips for weekends away just to relax. It means I get to be on the other side of the counter, and experience how other people look after their guests: and I take their good ideas back with me. 

(My manager, Max, has also travelled from afar to be here by the way, and he can also speak with our guests in Russian and Ukranian).

I even worked as a part-time tourist guide in Melbourne for a couple of years, and really enjoyed the interactions with the tourists off the huge cruise liners that appear in Melbourne each spring and summer. I have tried to extend this experience into my accommodation business here at home, where I really love assisting people with their stays. You only need to read the 800 plus reviews on Airbnb, Trip advisor, Goo gle, and on my own StayCentral website to realise how much our guests enjoy our apartments, and the way we look after them. 

I do love living in Melbourne. It enjoys a unique place in Australia. It is often described as the cultural, business, shopping and sporting capital of the country. The restaurants and cafes in Melbourne are amongst the best in the world. I love living in an urban village amongst these, and all the other everyday shops; and jumping on a tram and avoiding the hassles of traffic.

I started StayCentral with one apartment in 2005, and now manage multiple properties in many different locations in inner Melbourne.

Like many of my guests, I love to travel; both overseas to places like the Mulu Caves in Borneo, ancient cities (in many old countries), Antarctica & Alaska, Torres del Paine, and colourful markets in amazing places like Pha Long in Vietnam, Jaisalmer in India, & La Paz in Bolivia. I also love short domestic trips for weekends away just to relax. It means I get to be on the other side of the counter, and experience how other people look after their guests: and I take their good ideas back with me. 

(My manager, Max, has also travelled from afar to be here by the way, and he can also speak with our guests in Russian and Ukranian).

I even worked as a part-time tourist guide in Melbourne for a couple of years, and really enjoyed the interactions with the tourists off the huge cruise liners that appear in Melbourne each spring and summer. I have tried to extend this experience into my accommodation business here at home, where I really love assisting people with their stays. You only need to read the 800 plus reviews on Airbnb, Trip advisor, Goo gle, and on my own StayCentral website to realise how much our guests enjoy our apartments, and the way we look after them. 

I do love living in Melbourne. It enjoys a unique place in Australia. It is often described as the cultural, business, shopping and sporting capital of the country. The restaurants and cafes in Melbourne are amongst the best in the world. I love living in an urban village amongst these, and all the other everyday shops; and jumping on a tram and avoiding the hassles of traffic. It is a city of great opportunity, experiences, events and lifestyle that can be enjoyed by locals and visitors alike; and I really enjoy facilitating our guests' stays here.
